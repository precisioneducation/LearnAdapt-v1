## üìò Abstract

This paper introduces the **Ensemble of Specialized Large Language Models (ES-LLMs)** framework:  
a multi-agent architecture where LLMs act as distinct pedagogical agents ‚Äî TutorBot, ScaffoldBot, FeedbackBot, AssessmentBot, MotivatorBot, EthicsBot ‚Äî all coordinated by a central Meta-Orchestrator.  
Grounded in theories like Vygotsky‚Äôs ZPD, scaffolding, SRL, motivation theory, and AI ethics,  
ES-LLMs enables real-time adaptive learning that is pedagogically aligned, transparent, and scalable.

## üéØ Purpose and Contribution

- Moves beyond monolithic LLM tutors by introducing role-specialised orchestration
- Bridges foundational learning science with state-of-the-art AI capabilities
- Proposes seven pedagogical agents plus an orchestrator for coordinated instruction
- Offers a blueprint for real-time, ethical, and context-aware intelligent tutoring systems

## üß† Theoretical Foundations

| Learning Theory                        | Agent(s)            | Application                                        |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Zone of Proximal Development          | TutorBot            | Tailors instruction to learner's developmental zone |
| Scaffolding Theory                    | ScaffoldBot         | Provides tiered hints, gradually withdrawn         |
| Cognitive Load Theory                 | TutorBot, ScaffoldBot, FeedbackBot | Manages complexity and chunking           |
| Self-Regulated Learning               | FeedbackBot, AssessmentBot | Encourages reflection and monitoring         |
| Motivation Theory (Pintrich, Pekrun) | MotivatorBot        | Sends supportive, affect-aware prompts            |
| AI Ethics                             | EthicsBot           | Audits fairness, bias, and data protection        |

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Architecture

- Each agent is either **fine-tuned** or **prompt-engineered** for a specialised instructional role
- A **Meta-Orchestrator** routes tasks based on learner state and context
- Uses **PEFT** (LoRA, prompt tuning) and **alignment techniques** (RLHF, RLAIF, Constitutional AI)
- Modularity supports interpretability, agent fallback, and continuous adaptation

---

## ü§ñ The Agents

- **TutorBot:** Delivers adaptive instruction using Socratic methods
- **ScaffoldBot:** Provides step-based hints and support when learners are stuck
- **FeedbackBot:** Offers metacognitive and corrective feedback
- **AssessmentBot:** Conducts diagnostic and formative assessment
- **MotivatorBot:** Maintains engagement through positive reinforcement
- **EthicsBot:** Ensures fairness, privacy, and pedagogical responsibility
- **Meta-Orchestrator:** Coordinates agent flow in response to learner context

## üß™ Use Cases

**University Student (Amira):**  
Learns molecular biology with support from TutorBot, ScaffoldBot, and AssessmentBot.  
MotivatorBot helps after errors; EthicsBot reviews sensitive content.

**Adult Upskiller (Faizal):**  
Learns Python in a self-paced course. MotivatorBot encourages progress; ScaffoldBot supports debugging; system recalls progress history over days.

## üìö Educational Implications

- Enables **fine-grained personalization** through modular orchestration  
- Supports **teacher augmentation** rather than replacement  
- Promotes **ethical, inclusive, and scalable access** to AI tutoring  
- Aligns with Design AI principles and precision pedagogy

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work

- Requires orchestration memory and shared learner models  
- Hallucination risks and content accuracy concerns  
- Needs long-term evaluation across classrooms  
- Future directions: multimodal integration, orchestration learning, open standards for AI tutors

## üèÅ Conclusion

**ES-LLMs** represents a scalable vision of LLM-based tutoring that is  
role-specialised, evidence-based, and ethically grounded. It provides a flexible  
blueprint for realising **AI-enabled education that adapts, reflects, and supports learners**  
as humans do ‚Äî but with the scale and responsiveness of generative AI.
