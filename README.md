# LearnAdapt-v1 🧠📚  
**LLM-Enabled Adaptive Learning Platform (ES-LLMs Framework)**

Welcome to **LearnAdapt-v1**, the official research implementation of the  
**Ensemble of Specialized Large Language Models (ES-LLMs)** framework for  
precision pedagogy and adaptive tutoring.

Developed as part of my PhD at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD),  
this platform explores how orchestrated, role-specialised LLM agents can deliver  
real-time, personalised, and ethically aligned learning experiences at scale.

## 🚀 What is LearnAdapt?

**LearnAdapt** is a modular AI learning platform powered by a team of specialised LLM agents:

- 🧑‍🏫 `TutorBot` — for instruction and explanation  
- 🧩 `ScaffoldBot` — for hints and graduated support  
- 🧠 `FeedbackBot` — for metacognitive feedback  
- 📝 `AssessmentBot` — for formative and summative checks  
- 💬 `MotivatorBot` — for encouragement and affective support  
- 🛡️ `EthicsBot` — for fairness, inclusivity, and safety  
- 🎯 `Meta-Orchestrator` — for dynamic coordination of agents based on learner state

Built with a multi-agent architecture, **LearnAdapt** demonstrates how LLMs can be  
specialised, aligned, and orchestrated to mimic the pedagogical richness of a human teacher.
