# LearnAdapt-v1
LearnAdapt-v1 is the first implementation of the ES-LLMs framework â€” an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that orchestrates specialised LLM agents (e.g., TutorBot, ScaffoldBot, FeedbackBot) to deliver personalised, pedagogically aligned support in real-time. Built for research, experimentation, and real-world deployment.
